# Typescript_Assignment_14.3

● Create a service with get method using any public API, you can call API from APIs link or any other
● Create a method in your component to call that service using observable.
● Again create a method in your component to call that service using promise.

Notes:

I've used angular-cli for this project and so it will run with command: ng serve on localhost:4200
Service is in user.service
data to be rendered is obtained from a json placeholder
component is in app.component
view rendered in app.component.html
